# Notebooks with Figures of the SYGMA paper

Each notebook contains figures for the sections of the SYGMA paper [(Ritter et al. 2017)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv171109172R).
To visualize the figures start the jupyter server through start_notebook_server.sh and execute the notebooks.

The simulations and figures presented in the SYGMA paper have been calculated with [NuPyCEE 3.0](https://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE/releases/tag/v3.0).
