    "Faint supernovae are low luminosity core-collapse supernovae characterised by their relatively small generation of Nickel-56 [Nomoto et al. 2013](http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-astro-082812-140956 ''title''). Nuclei that originate from the silicon burning regions of a star, undergo fallback if the explosion energy is too low to overcome gravitational attraction. The mass of the content that undergoes fallback is called the 'mass cut'. Anything above this mass cut is pushed outwards by the explosion, while the material underneath undergoes neutronisation/destruction by the formation of a black hole. The material that is ejected tend to include oxygen and carbon nuclei. Mixing may also occur at the masscut, so that near-iron nuclei may still be ejected. The mixing and fallback model is described in more detail by [Umeda & Nomoto 2002](http://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1086/323946/pdf ''title'')\n",

    "This project uses OMEGA (One-zone Model for the Evolution of Galaxies) to simulate the chemical evolution of galaxies and to plot the expected abundance ratios of titanium, oxygen, iron, hydrogen and carbon. The main plots show the how the abundance of these elements (with respect to hydrogen) change with both time and stellar metallicity. Fe/H is assumed to be a measure of metallicity, as higher Fe/H values indicate a higher proportion of metal relative to hydrogen. Fe/H is also a rough indicator of the age of stellar populations as metallicity tends to increase with time, and the age of stars can be difficult to determine. We plot the predictions of OMEGA with and without the yields of faint supernovae. Therefore, we can emanine the impact of faint supernovae on the abundance of certain elements. We have made the approximation that the yields of 20MSun pre-supernovae stars are representative of faint supernovae in the 15-40 MSun mass range. \n",
