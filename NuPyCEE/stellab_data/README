This directory contains the stellar abundance data read
by STELLAB and by OMEGA.

The STELLAB module reads only files available in 

	abundance_data_library.txt

You can use your own data set with STELLAB.

1) Add your own data set (table file) into this directory
   or a subdirectory.
2) Add a line to abundance_data_library.txt to make your table
   visible for STELLAB.
   Each line has the path to the table file, the name as it
   will appear in any figure legend and the marker-color combination
   for the style of the data points.
