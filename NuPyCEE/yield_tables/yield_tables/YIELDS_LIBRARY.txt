	Combined yield set of Portinari et al. and Marigo: !!Needs confirmation

		Use net yields of Portinari and Marigo.
		To use net yields input the following parameter are needed: yield_interp_st='wiersma', netyields_on_st=True and wiersmamod_st=True
		Net yields with masses up to 7Msun are from Marigo, above those of Portinari are taken.  
		Only isotopes are selected which are available in both yield sets and go up to Fe.

		Tables:
			Ritter et al. 2017, In table Z=0.0127,0.004 based on Z=0.019 and Z=0.004 yields from Margio and Z=0.02 and Z=0.004 yields from Portinari.
			Initial masses go from the lowest mass available up to 100Msun.

			Table with Z=0.004,0.008,0.02 based on Z=0.019 and Z=0.008, 0.004 yields from Margio and Z=0.02,0.008,0.004 yields from Portinari	
			All initial masses available are taken which go up to 1000Msun.
			100Msun at Z=0.008 not available and replaced with 120Msun.
			The 60Msun at Z=0.004 is not available and replaced with the 40Msun.
			For uniform grid use 1, 1.65,2.0, 2.2, 2.5, 3.0, 3.5,4.0, 4.5, 5.0 and the closest available mass.

		AGB yields are from FRUITY and massive star yields (delayed explosion) from NuGrid. Lifetimes for AGB models 
		were taken from NuGrid. Note NuGrid models are based on alpha-enhanced initial abundances 
		at Z=0.006 and Z=0.001 while FRUITY models are not. 
		Note: Adjust the yield mass range to imf_yields_range=[1.3,30].
