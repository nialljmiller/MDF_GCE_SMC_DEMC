H Decay information for working with radioactive species.
H Column 1: Unstable isotope.
H Column 2: Stable isotope where the unstable isotope decays.
H Column 3: Half-life of the unstable isotope [yr].
H  
H Note: For isotopes having multiple decay channels, put H-1
H       in Column 2, and 0.000E+00 in Column 3.  Then add 
H       « use_decay_module=True » in the list of parameters
H       when calling OMEGA/SYGMA. This will use the decay
H       module and will ignore the 2nd and 3rd columns of
H       this file. The first column will still be used by
H       the code to select which radioactive isotopes are
H       accounted for in the yields.
