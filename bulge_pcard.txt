# Population size of the genetic algorithm. 
# i.e how many individuals (/walkers/trials/iterations...) do we process per each generation
# NB - this is not the number of evaluations as evaluations are only made if a crossover or/and mutation has been done to the individual
# Justification: 128 allows diversity while feasible computationally; scales with param dimensions (~15 here).
# References: Goldberg (1989, Genetic Algorithms book) for popsize ~100-200 in complex spaces.

# Probability that any given individual is mutated by the GA
# High probability = high genetic diversity but risks destroying the signal found with a good fit.

selection_threshold: -1

# Tournament selection is used to determine next population. Each round of individuals is split into tournaments of size {tournament_size} and the fittest individual from this tournament is kept for future evaluations.
# Small tournament size - higher genetic diversity but slower convergence. Also a risk that convergence never happens increases. 
# High tournament size - faster convergence as most likely that the population best is represented. this also reduces genetic diversity running the risk of only finding a local minima
# Example : fitting a straight line to a sigmoid. The fastest good enough convergence will be a straight line. 
# What happens in the likely scenario if the straight line appears in the sample of individuals without a more sophisticated sigmoid guess? i.e. a low order poly will appear before a high order in the evolutionary steps (assuming a naive prior).
# A high tournament size will be more likely to focus on faster and simpler solutions to this problem.
# Justification: Size 2 balances diversity and selection pressure.

# Sigma 2 list: Controls the ratio of second to first infall rates.
# sigma_2 = c2/c1 (equations 5 and 6 in Spitoni et al. 2019)
# 
# Two scenarios: 
# - one-infall model: sigma_2 = 1e9 to suppress first infall entirely
# - two-infall model: sweep sigma_2 between reasonable values
#
# Setting the ratio to be outrageous (1e9) suppresses the first infall entirely
# Justification: Ratio 0.5-20 covers weak (bulge-dominated, ratio <1) to strong (disk-like, ratio >1) second infall; extended upper to 20 for gradual accretion in extended models.
# Contentious: High ratios (>10) may over-dilute metals, but tested in recent simulations; typical bulge ratios 1-5, but up to 20 allows exploration of extreme dilution scenarios.

# If the bulge is being continuously fed by the disk over all time, this should be ~10 Gyr
# Default thick disk assumption: 3 Gyr to fall in, coming in at [Fe/H] -0.5  
# Default thin disk: 5 Gyr to fall in, coming in at solar composition
# Justification for infall_timescale_1: 0.001-0.1 Gyr for ultra-fast decay in initial bulge collapse, enabling rapid enrichment to match metal-poor plateau; updated upper to 0.1 for stability and alignment with clumpy infall models.
# Contentious: Very short (<0.001 Gyr) unphysical as it implies instantaneous collapse; 0.01-0.1 Gyr more common to avoid over-enrichment spikes.

# For each infall episode, exp_infall --> [Norm, t_max, timescale]
# 'exp_infall':[[-1, 0.1e9, 0.1e9], [A2, t_2*1e9, infall_2*1e9]]
# Justification: A1=-1 for auto-normalization to target mass; A2=1 as relative scaleâ€”unchanged but noted for two-infall balance.
# Contentious: Fixed A2=1 assumes equal normalization; variable A2 (0.5-2) could test mass ratios, but kept simple.
# References: Spitoni et al. (2019) for A2/A1 ~1-5; Chiappini et al. (2001) for normalization in equations.
